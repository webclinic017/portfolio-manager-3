# portfolio-manager
 
Small tool made for personal portfolio management used by me and my close friends. This project started from a simple need to automate aggregation of information from different sources into same place for more time effecient portfolio management. After few iterations, notebook evolved into simple dash web app for more interactive UI. Some of the functionality relies on files exported from Nordnet and Inderes websites.
 
I have been using this a my playground for testing new things, like time series forecasting techniques on stock data. Time series forecasting done here is by no means suitable for real investment decisions :)
